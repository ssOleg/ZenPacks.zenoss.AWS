This ZenPack provides support for monitoring Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Monitoring for the following EC2 entities is provided through a combination of
the AWS EC2 and CloudWatch APIs.

{{note}} This ZenPack supersedes the older ZenAWS (ZenPacks.zenoss.ZenAWS) ZenPack that was installed by default on versions of Zenoss prior to 4.2.4. Please remove ZenAWS before installing this ZenPack. This will remove the /EC2 device class and the EC2Manager device within. After installing this ZenPack, you will be able to add a new EC2 Account with much greater functionality.

== Features ==

The features added by this ZenPack can be summarized as follows. They are each
detailed further below.

* Discovery of EC2 entities.
* Monitoring of CloudWatch metrics.
* Optional auto-discovery and monitoring of instance guest operating systems.
* Optional service impact with addition of Zenoss Service Dynamics product.

=== Discovery ===

The following entities will be automatically discovered through an account
name, access key and secret key you provide. The attributes, tags and
collections will be updated on Zenoss' normal remodeling interval which
defaults to every 12 hours.

;Regions
: Attributes: ID
: Collections: VPCs, Subnets, Zones, Instances, Volumes

;Zones
: Attributes: ID, Region, State
: Collections: Instances, Volumes, Subnets

;VPCs
: Attributes: ID, Region, CIDR Block
: Tags: Name, Collector
: Collections: Subnets, Instances

;Subnets
: Attributes: ID, Region, VPC, Zone, State, CIDR Block, Available IP Address Count, Zone Default, Auto-Public IP
: Tags: Name
: Collections: Instances

;Instances
: Attributes: ID, Region, VPC, Zone, Subnet, State, Instance Type, Image ID, Platform, Public DNS Name, Private IP Address, Launch Time, Guest Device
: Tags: Name
: Collections: Volumes
: Other: Guest Device (if monitored by Zenoss)

;Volumes
: Attributes: ID, Region, Zone, Instance, Type Created Time, Size, IOPS, Status, Attach Data Status, Attach Data Device
: Tags: Name

=== Monitoring ===

The following metrics will be collected every 5 minutes by default. Any other
CloudWatch metrics can also be collected by adding them to the appropriate
monitoring template. The ''Average'' statistic is collected, and the graphed
value is per second for anything that resembles a rate.

;Regions
: Metrics: CPUUtilization, DiskReadOps, DiskWriteOps, DiskReadBytes, DiskWriteBytes, NetworkIn, NetworkOut

;Instances
: Metrics: CPUUtilization, DiskReadOps, DiskWriteOps, DiskReadBytes, DiskWriteBytes, NetworkIn, NetworkOut, StatusCheckFailed_Instance, StatusCheckFailed_System

;Volumes
: Metrics: VolumeReadBytes, VolumeWriteBytes, VolumeReadOps, VolumeWriteOps, VolumeTotalReadTime, VolumeTotalWriteTime, VolumeIdleTime, VolumeQueueLength
: Provisioned IOPS Metrics: VolumeThroughputPercentage, VolumeReadWriteOps

The ''Amazon CloudWatch'' datasource type also allows for the collection of any
other CloudWatch metric.

=== Guest Device Discovery ===

You can optionally configure each monitored AWS account to attempt to discover
and monitor the guest Linux or Windows operating systems running within each
EC2 instance. This requires that your Zenoss system has the network and server
access it needs to monitor the guest operating system. VPC and non-VPC modes
are supported.

The guest operating system devices' life-cycle are managed along with the
instance. For example, the guest operating system device is set to a
decommissioned production state when the EC2 instance is stopped, and the
guest operating system device is deleted when the EC2 instance is destroyed.

=== Service Impact ===

When combined with the Zenoss Service Dynamics product, this ZenPack adds
built-in service impact capability for services running on AWS. The following
service impact relationships are automatically added. These will be included
in any services that contain one or more of the explicitly mentioned entities.

;Service Impact Relationships
* Account access failure impacts all regions.
* Region failure affects all VPCs and zones in affected region.
* VPC failure affects all related subnets.
* Zone failure affects all related subnets, instances and volumes.
* Subnet failure affects all instances on affected subnet.
* Volume failure affects any attached instance.
* Instance failure affects the guest operating system device.

== Usage ==

=== Adding AWS Accounts ===

Use the following steps to start monitoring EC2 using the Zenoss web interface.

# Navigate to the Infrastructure page.
# Choose ''Add EC2 Account'' from the add device button.
# Enter your AWS account name, access key and secret key.
# Optionally choose a collector other than the default ''localhost''.
# Click ''Add''.

Alternatively you can use zenbatchload to add accounts from the command line.
To do this, you must create a file with contents similar to the following.
Replace all values in angle brackets with your values minus the brackets.
Multiple accounts can be added under the same ''/Device/AWS/EC2'' section.

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
/Devices/AWS/EC2 loader='ec2account', loader_arg_keys=['accountname', 'accesskey', 'secretkey', 'collector']
<accountname> accountname='<accountname>', accesskey='<accesskey>', secretkey='<secretkey>', collector='<collector>'
</syntaxhighlight>

You can then load the account(s) with the following command.

<console>
$ ##i##zenbatchload <filename>
</console>

=== Configuring Guest Device Discovery ===

Use the following steps to configure instance guest device discovery. Guest
device discovery must be configured individually for each EC2 account.

# Navigate to one of the EC2 accounts.
# Click the edit link beside ''Device Class for Discovered Linux Instances''
# Choose the device class for Linux and/or Windows instances.
# Verify that appropriate SSH, SNMP or Windows credentials are configured for the chosen device class(es).
# Remodel the EC2 account by choosing ''Model Device'' from its menu.

If your instances are VPC instances, and are in a different VPC than the
Zenoss server that's monitoring the EC2 account, you must add a ''Collector''
tag to containing VPC with the value set to the name of the Zenoss collector
to which discovered guest devices should be assigned.
